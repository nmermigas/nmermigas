# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub!

Hi, I’m **Nikos Mermigkas** — a **T-shaped software engineer** passionate about building reliable, scalable, and user-centric products.  
I love bridging the gap between **frontend, backend, and mobile**, turning ideas into polished, production-ready systems.

Currently, I’m working as a **Full-Stack (Android & Web) Developer at CHECK24**, where I’ve built end-to-end features used by thousands of users — from native Android experiences in **Kotlin/Compose** to backend automation in **Mezzio (PHP)** and **Dockerized environments**.

---

## 🔭 What I’m Working On
- **Android & Web Development** — Building features for CHECK24’s GKV app with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and clean architecture principles.  
- **Full-Stack Projects** —  
  - **FlexiJobs (in development):** Cross-platform job-listing app using **React Native**, **NestJS**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Prisma**.  
  - **TutorFlow (prototype):** A **Next.js + Supabase** platform for teachers to share resources, assign tasks, manage payments, and integrate **semantic search (RAG)**.  
- **Applied AI** — Experimenting with **LLMs**, **vector search**, and **retrieval-augmented generation** for real-world applications.

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning & Exploring
- Advanced **Android/Kotlin** patterns (Compose, architecture, modularization)  
- **Full-stack web frameworks**: Next.js, NestJS, Supabase  
- **Applied ML** for information retrieval, RAG pipelines, and lightweight deployment  

---

## 🚀 Experience Highlights
- **CHECK24:**  
  - Converted legacy WebViews to native Android flows, achieving **100 % user coverage** and smoother lead-closing experiences.  
  - Delivered new modules like *Wahltarif* (cashback tariff selection) and automated contract-cancellation backend flows.  
- **IBM:**  
  - Integrated and optimized **BERT-based NLP** for Greek, improving sentiment and entity-recognition models.  
- **Airbus (via Alten):**  
  - Tested and validated aircraft connectivity systems (ALNA 4.0) ensuring compliance and reliability.

## 🎸 Outside of Tech
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:  
🎸 Playing guitar 💪 Lifting at the gym 📚 Reading about tech, startups, and economics
