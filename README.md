# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello and welcome👋! I'm delighted to have you explore my GitHub profile repository. This space offers a glimpse into my tech-infused journey and love for coding.

## About Me

I'm a tech enthusiast who studied  Management Science and Technology at Athens University of Economics and Business. This unique blend of disciplines has equipped me with a strategic outlook and a knack for problem-solving, utilizing technology.

## Currently...

I'm on an exciting expedition, navigating the realms of **PyTorch** and **Node.js**. I find myself balancing my interest about software development and Machine Learning Engineering. This repository will showcase my learning process, experiments, and coding adventures.


## Highlights

Here's a glimpse of what you'll find here:

- **Applied Machine Learning 🐍🤖:** The repository contains three applied machine learning projects completed as part of the Applied Machine Learning university course of my senior year. Each project focuses on exploring real-world datasets and applying various machine learning and data science techniques. The complexity of the projects gradually increases, from creating meaningful plots, performing EDA and feature engineering to comparing various predictive models.

- **Node.js 🟢:** Discover my experiments with Node.js, where I harness its versatility to create applications across domains. If you're interested in exploring my Node.js projects, you can check out my dedicated repository for them. Here's the link: [Node.js Projects Repository](https://github.com/nmermigas/nodejs-projects).


- **PyTorch 🔥:** Follow my journey into the world of deep learning as I tinker with PyTorch to build and train neural networks. Repo soon to be announced...


## Hobbies

When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me pursuing my hobbies:

🎸 Strumming the Guitar: Music is my escape, and I love playing tunes on my guitar.
💪 Hitting the Gym: I'm a fitness enthusiast, and you'll often find me working out and pushing my limits.
