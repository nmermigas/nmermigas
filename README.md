# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi, I’m Nikos! I’m a Software Engineer passionate about building impactful and reliable software.  
Currently, I’m working as an **Android & Web Developer at Check24**, where I develop user-facing features in **Kotlin, Java, TypeScript, and Angular**.  

My journey started with a strong academic foundation in **Management Science & Technology (AUEB)** and an **AI/NLP internship at IBM**, where I worked on natural language processing for underrepresented languages. Since then, I’ve continued to grow across mobile, web, and backend development — always keeping an eye on Machine Learning and its applications in real-world systems.

## 🔭 What I’m Working On
- Developing Android and web features in **Kotlin/Java** & **Angular/TypeScript/PHP**  
- Building side projects in **React Native** & **Nest.js**  
- Exploring **PyTorch** and modern ML frameworks with the goal of deepening my expertise in NLP, LLMs, and applied AI  

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- **Advanced Android/Kotlin** patterns and clean architecture  
- **Full-stack web development** with TypeScript, React, and Nest.js  
- **Machine Learning foundations** (NLP, vector search, RAG, LLM fine-tuning)  

---

## 🚀 Highlights
- **Applied Machine Learning 🐍🤖:** The repository contains three applied machine learning projects completed as part of the Applied Machine Learning university course of my senior year. Each project focuses on exploring real-world datasets and applying various machine learning and data science techniques. The complexity of the projects gradually increases, from creating meaningful plots, performing EDA and feature engineering to comparing various predictive models. Check it out!

## 🎸 Outside of Tech
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:
- 🎸 Playing guitar  
- 💪 Training at the gym  
- 📚 Reading about tech, economics, or social sciences
